# Network
Social Network - created as first PHP project in order to learn PHP

This was my first large scale project (when I was 14).

I started this project knowing that it was going to remain uncompleted as it was just to practise my HTML, CSS, MySQL, and PHP. It furthered my knowledge in MySQL and PHP especially. I also set up a logging system to log everything on the site.

As I did not know much about programming at all at this point, I took challenges as they came and didn't put much thought into planning compared to later projects. This often meant that total restructuring of the website had to take place, and the code was left very messy.

WARNING: There was no emphasise put on design, and please excuse the code...

Nevertheless, it was a great project to get stuck into web development with.

Overall, I spent 3-4 months (on-and-off) on this project.
